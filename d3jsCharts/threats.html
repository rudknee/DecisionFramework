            <h1>Common Cyber Security Threats</h1>
            <p>Understanding the threats you face is the first step to protecting your organization. Here are some of the most common types of cyber attacks:</p>

            <div class="threat">
                <h2>Phishing</h2>
                <p>Phishing attacks are fraudulent attempts, usually made through email, to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details. Attackers disguise themselves as a trustworthy entity to trick the victim into opening a malicious link or attachment.</p>
                <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Employee training is key. Teach your staff to be suspicious of unsolicited emails, to check sender addresses, and to avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Use email filters to block spam and phishing attempts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="threat">
                <h2>Malware</h2>
                <p>Malware, short for malicious software, is a broad term for any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. This includes viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware.</p>
                <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Use reputable anti-malware and antivirus software on all systems. Keep software and operating systems updated to patch vulnerabilities that malware often exploits. Be cautious about downloading files from the internet.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="threat">
                <h2>Ransomware</h2>
                <p>Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files. The attacker then demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the data upon payment.</p>
                <p><strong>Defense:</strong> The best defense is a robust backup strategy. Regularly back up all important data to an offsite location and test the backups to ensure they can be restored. This way, you can recover your data without paying a ransom.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="threat">
                <h2>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks</h2>
                <p>A Denial-of-Service attack floods a system's resources so that it cannot respond to legitimate service requests. A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a DoS attack that uses multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic.</p>
                <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Use a firewall and consider a DDoS mitigation service from your internet service provider or a cloud provider. These services can detect and filter out malicious traffic before it reaches your network.</p>
