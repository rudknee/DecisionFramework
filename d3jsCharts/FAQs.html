             <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h2>What is cyber insurance?</h2>
<p>Cyber insurance is a type of insurance policy that helps protect your business from the financial impact of cyber incidents such as hacking, data breaches, ransomware, and other digital threats. It can cover costs like data recovery, legal fees, customer notification, and business interruption.</p>

<h2>Why would an SME need cyber insurance?</h2>
<p>SMEs are increasingly targeted by cybercriminals because they often have weaker security than large corporations. Cyber insurance can help cover the high costs of recovering from an attack, protect your reputation, and ensure your business can continue operating after an incident.</p>

<h2>What does a typical cyber insurance policy cover?</h2>
<p>Coverage can vary, but common inclusions are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data breach response costs (investigation, notifications, credit monitoring)</li>
    <li>Ransomware payments (if allowed by law)</li>
    <li>Business interruption losses</li>
    <li>Legal defense and regulatory fines (where legally insurable)</li>
    <li>Public relations and reputation management</li>
    <li>Third-party liability (claims from affected customers or partners)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is not covered by cyber insurance?</h2>
<p>Exclusions depend on the insurer, but common ones include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pre-existing known issues</li>
    <li>Failure to maintain basic security measures</li>
    <li>Acts of war or terrorism</li>
    <li>Intentional or criminal acts by the insured</li>
</ul>
<p>Always read the policy wording carefully.</p>

<h2>How much does cyber insurance cost for an SME?</h2>
<p>Premiums vary depending on your business size, industry, type of data handled, annual revenue, and security measures in place. For SMEs, policies can start from a few hundred dollars per year but may cost more for high-risk sectors like finance or healthcare.</p>

<h2>Will cyber insurance replace the need for good cyber security?</h2>
<p>No. Cyber insurance is not a substitute for robust cyber security. Insurers often require proof that you have adequate protections like firewalls, anti-malware tools, backups, and employee training before issuing a policy.</p>

<h2>How does the claims process work?</h2>
<p>When an incident occurs:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Notify your insurer immediately (many have 24/7 hotlines).</li>
    <li>They may assign an incident response team to investigate.</li>
    <li>Work with their specialists to contain the threat and assess damage.</li>
    <li>Submit required documentation and evidence for your claim.</li>
    <li>The insurer reviews and, if approved, pays according to your policy terms.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Will my insurer help me during an attack?</h2>
<p>Most reputable cyber insurers provide incident response services, including IT forensics, legal guidance, PR advice, and even negotiation support in ransomware cases.</p>

<h2>Can cyber insurance help with regulatory compliance?</h2>
<p>While it doesn’t make you compliant, cyber insurance can help cover costs if a breach triggers regulatory investigations or penalties. It also often comes with access to cyber risk assessments and training resources.</p>

<h2>How do I choose the right cyber insurance policy?</h2>
<p>Consider the following when choosing a policy:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The type of data you handle (personal, financial, health)</li>
    <li>Your industry’s risk level</li>
    <li>The level of coverage vs. potential loss</li>
    <li>Policy exclusions and limits</li>
    <li>Value-added services (incident response, training)</li>
</ul>
