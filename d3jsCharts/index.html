            <h1>Cyber Security Guide</h1>
            <p>The guide below is a question-based flowchart to aid decision-makers in thinking through their organization's cyber security posture and potential need for cyber insurance.</p>
            <p>The guide aims not to be overly prescriptive and does not claim to cover all use-cases. Rather, it seeks to support decision-making by helping the user explore which actions could be beneficial to their use case. Whether a particular solution is suitable will depend on the specific context, and results from the Guide should be read as suggestions to explore rather than definitive solutions.</p>
            <p>It is also important to understand that using an individual tool or control does not in itself guarantee security unless accompanied by a good overall security design and appropriate governance. You can explore good practices <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Using the guide</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The guide is primarily aimed at business owners, IT managers, and decision-makers.</li>
                <li>Answer the questions that appear in the decision tree by clicking on the box containing the appropriate answer. Do this until you reach an end node which will suggest a course of action.</li>
                <li>Each end node can be clicked to lead to a page that describes the suggested action in more detail.</li>
                <li>You can explore the whole decision tree structure by clicking to expand the various different nodes in the tree.</li>
                <li>Click and drag within the black box to pan through the tree diagram, and use your mouse wheel or trackpad to zoom in and out.</li>
            </ul>
