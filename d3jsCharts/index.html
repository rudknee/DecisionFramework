            <h1>Welcome to the Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) Cyber Insurance Decision Support Framework</h1>
             <p>SMEs are increasingly reliant on digital systems to deliver products and services, making them more vulnerable to cyber threats such as ransomware, phishing, and data breaches. These threats can lead to severe financial and reputational losses, particularly for SMEs that often lack the financial resources, cybersecurity expertise, or dedicated IT staff to respond effectively. In response to these risks, cyber insurance has emerged as a potential solution for transferring residual cyber risk and supporting recovery. 
                <p>However, SMEs often lack access to decision-support tools or frameworks that could help them evaluate whether and how cyber insurance fits within their broader cyber risk management strategy. Without this guidance, SMEs are either choosing to forgo coverage altogether or purchasing policies that may not suit their specific needs, ultimately undermining their ability to recover from cyber incidents or build resilience.
                <strong>Our framework is here to help.</strong> </p>
             <p>Backed by research and developed for SMEs, this web application will walk you through key decisions and help you make an informed choice.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Understand your risk,</li>
             <li>Learn what to look for in a policy, and </li>
             <li>Receive tailored guidance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The guide below is a question-based flowchart to aid you in thinking through your organization's cyber security posture and potential need for cyber insurance.</p>
            <h2>About the Framework</h2>
            <p>This framework was developed following extensive research to understand how SMEs approach cyber insurance. We analysed proposal forms, reviewed academic and industry literature, and consulted stakeholders such as SMEs, Insurers and Brokers, Researchers etc through an interview study.</p>
  <p>The framework helps SMEs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assess their cyber risks</li>
    <li>Clarify their needs</li>
    <li>Make practical insurance decisions aligned with their security posture</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is tailored for SMEs by design, not by compromise. </p>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>This step-by-step framework guides you through a decision tree. Each step will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask a simple question about your business or security practices.</li>
    <li>Guide you to a recommendation based on your responses.</li>
    <li>Provide helpful notes to explain your recommended actions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The framework ends with a tailored action plan. No personal data is collected, and you can retake it as often as needed.</p>
  <p>This framework currently works best on desktop devices. Mobile support is not available at this time.</p>
