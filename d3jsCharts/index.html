            <h1>Welcome to the SME Cyber Insurance Decision Support Framework</h1>
             <p>Cyber threats are real and SMEs are increasingly targeted. Yet many Small to Medium-sized Enterprises are unsure how to choose cyber insurance that matches their risks and needs. Our framework is here to help.</p>
             <p>Backed by research and developed for SMEs, this web application will walk you through key decisions and help you make an informed choice.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Understand your risk,</li>
             <li>Learn what to look for in a policy, and </li>
             <li>Receive tailored guidance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The guide below is a question-based flowchart to aid decision-makers in thinking through their organization's cyber security posture and potential need for cyber insurance.</p>
         
            <h2>About the Framework</h2>
            <p>This framework was developed following extensive research to understand how SMEs approach cyber insurance. We analysed proposal forms, reviewed academic and industry literature, and consulted stakeholders such as SMEs, Insurers and Brokers, Researchers etc through an interview study.</p>
  <p>The framework helps SMEs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assess their cyber risks</li>
    <li>Clarify their needs</li>
    <li>Make practical insurance decisions aligned with their security posture</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is tailored for SMEs by design, not by compromise.</p>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>This step-by-step framework guides you through a decision tree. Each step will:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask a simple question about your business or security practices.</li>
    <li>Provide helpful notes to explain what your choices mean.</li>
    <li>Guide you to a recommendation based on your responses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The framework ends with a tailored action plan. No personal data is collected, and you can retake it as often as needed.</p>
