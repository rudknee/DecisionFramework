             <h1>Cyber Security and Cyber Insurance 101</h1>
             <p>
</p><strong>Cyber security </strong> is the practice of helping individuals and organisations reduce the likelihood of falling victim to cyber attacks.
<p>Its main purpose is to safeguard the devices we use every day such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and computers as well as the online and workplace services we rely on, protecting them from theft, damage, or unauthorised access. It also involves securing the large amounts of personal data stored on these devices and online platforms. </p>

<p>The importance of cyber security lies in the fact that smartphones, computers, and the internet are now integral to modern life. From online banking and shopping to email and social media, these tools are essential for daily activities. This makes it more critical than ever to take measures that protect our accounts, data, and devices from cyber criminals.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber insurance </strong> is a safety net for your business in case of a cyber attack. It helps cover the costs of things like recovering lost data, fixing damaged systems, notifying affected customers, and dealing with legal or financial losses after an incident. Think of it as insurance that protects your business from the financial impact of online threats like hacking, data breaches, or ransomware.</p>
<p>Cyber insurance protects your business from the financial impact of cyber incidents like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ransomware attacks</li>
    <li>Data breaches</li>
    <li>Business interruption</li>
    <li>Legal liabilities from leaked data</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Common Types of Cover</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>First-party:</strong> Costs related to your own losses (e.g. recovery costs, lost revenue).</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party:</strong> Costs from claims against you (e.g. legal fees, customer notifications).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Insurance is not a silver bullet—but it is a valuable tool in your cyber defence strategy.</p>
  <h2>How Cyber Insurance works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When you purchase an insurance policy, you agree to pay regular premiums to the insurer. If you file a claim, the insurer will compensate you for any loss covered under the policy.

<li>If no claim is made, you won’t receive your premiums back; instead, your payments are combined with those from other policyholders insured by the same company. When a claim is approved, the payout is drawn from this shared pool of premiums.</li>
  </ul>
        <h2>Why Cyber Insurance Matters for SMEs</h2>
  <p>SMEs are not too small to be targeted. In fact, attackers often prefer them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Over 60% of SMEs experience a cyber incident each year.</li>
    <li>Cyber crime costs a business around £15,300 if they fall victim and it could be more.</li>
    <li>The average recovery cost can exceed $100,000.</li>
    <li>Yet more than 80% of cyber-attacks could be prevented with good cyber hygiene.</li>
    <li>Many SMEs close down within six months after a major breach.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Cyber insurance can mean the difference between survival and shutdown. It helps you respond faster, limit damage, and avoid legal or reputational disasters.</p>
